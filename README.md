# My second React app

This time, my second app is a Movie Search app using the [OMDB Api](http://www.omdbapi.com/). The challenge here was to remove dependency on Redux and use entirely Hooks. Building the app took me a while to get started as I had no concept to reference. But it became fun afterwards once I _somehow_ had a concept in my head. This [nifty tutorial](https://blog.bitsrc.io/writing-your-own-custom-hooks-4fbcf77e112e) made things much more fun when I realized I can actually write custom Hooks...

I'm still using the [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) library as I still to brush up `CSS` skills just yet.

As always, code reviews are greatly appreciated!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Starting the app:

### Step 1:

In the `/` directory, run:

> `npm install` or `yarn`

This installs all the required dependencies for the React app.

### Step 2:

In the `/` directory, you can run:

> `npm start` or `yarn start`

This starts the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
